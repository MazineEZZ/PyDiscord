## Installation

In order to run this application you of course need python since it is based on that language, and you also need some dependencies. I've included a file that simplifies this process, so feel free to download the file.

## Usage

Once you are in the application, you should see this interface:

**REMINDER:** If you want to log-in, you need a username and a password. Currently there is only two users, you can check them in the *code/json_files/users.json* or maybe even add your own username and password ;).
